# Data Visualization

The main goal of this lecture is to inspire. It tries to show that data visualization is an extremely diverse and creative, however powerful tool that can be used to explore data, communicate results and tell stories. It is not a lecture about how to make a specific plot using a specific software, but rather about how to think about data visualization and how to approach it mentally. It broadly mentions the topics of why exactly we make nice plots (and plots in general), what practical aspects should we consider when making them and how enormous the possibilities are for their creation.
