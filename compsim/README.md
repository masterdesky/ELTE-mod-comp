# Computer Simulations

This lecture serves as a general introduction to computer simulations, starting from the theoretical idea to the practical implementation and analysis of the results. It should give the students a general idea of how to even approach the concept of computer simulations, what makes them different from general scientific computing and what can they tell us about the world around us that we cannot learn from other methods.
